Next Steps
Define Your Models: Start fleshing out your models in the models folder based on the data you need to manage (e.g., user data, tasks, calendar events).

Set Up Routes: Implement the routes needed to handle requests from your frontend, including CRUD operations for your models.

Database Migrations: If you plan to use migrations, consider integrating a migration tool like Flask-Migrate to manage changes to your database schema over time.

Testing: Think about adding a tests/ directory for unit tests to ensure your backend behaves as expected.

Documentation: Keep your README.md updated with relevant information on how to set up and run your application.

With this structure and the plans for future integration, you're well on your way to creating a robust backend for your application! If you need help with specific features or implementation details, feel free to ask!
